# Summary（总结）

This concludes our chapter about QML networking. Please bear in mind Qt has on the native side a much richer networking API as on the QML side currently. But the idea of the chapter is to push the boundaries of QML networking and how to integrate with cloud-based services.

本章关于QML网络的内容就到此结束了。请记住，Qt在原生端拥有一个丰富的网络API，而QML端目前还没有。但本章的目的是推动QML网络的发展，以及如何与基于云的服务进行集成。
