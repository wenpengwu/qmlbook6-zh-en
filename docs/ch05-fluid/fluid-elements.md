# Fluid Elements(流体元素)

Until now, we have mostly looked at some simple graphical elements and how to arrange and manipulate them. 

到目前为止，我们主要关注了一些简单的图形元素及其排列和操作方法。

This chapter is about how to make these changes more interesting by animating them. 

本章将介绍如何通过动画使这些变化更加生动。

Animations are one of the key foundations for modern, slick user interfaces, and can be employed in your user interface via states, transitions and animations. Each state defines a set of property changes and can be combined with animations on state changes. These changes are described as a transition from one state to another state.

动画是现代、光滑用户界面的重要基础，可以通过状态、过渡和动画来使用它们。每个状态定义了一组属性变化，并且可以在状态变化时与动画结合使用。这些变化被描述为从一个状态到另一个状态的过渡。

Besides animations being used during transitions, they can also be used as standalone elements triggered by some scripted events.

除了在状态转换过程中使用动画外，动画还可以作为独立的元素由某些脚本事件触发。
