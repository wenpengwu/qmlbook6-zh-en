# Welcome!(欢迎)

Welcome to The Qt 6 Book - A book about QML. This text will guide you through QML, Qt's language for creating dynamic user interfaces. 

欢迎来到 Qt 6 书籍 - 一本关于 QML 的书。本文将指导您了解 QML，这是 Qt 用于创建动态用户界面的语言。

I believe that the ability to build declarative, reactive, hardware accelerated user interfaces executing at native performance across *all* major platforms (and some not so major) is a game changer. When starting with Qt, it was almost as if I had my secret weapon to building software quickly. QML takes that to the next level.

我相信，构建声明式、反应式、硬件加速的用户界面在所有主要平台（以及一些不太主要的平台）上以本机性能执行的能力将改变游戏规则。当开始使用 Qt 时，我几乎就像拥有快速构建软件的秘密武器。QML 将其提升到一个新的水平。

How is this book different from the Qt documentation? I hear you ask. The intention is to build a complement. This book is meant as a book that you can read from front to back where each chapter builds on what you've previously learned. But it can also be used as a way for the experienced reader to get oriented in a new topic. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic and introduces the concepts from Qt and QML. However, the Qt documentation will always provide the full picture and is a great reference to look up the details about all elements, properties, enumerations, and more.

这本书与 Qt 文档有什么不同？您可能会问。我们的意图是创建一个补充。这本书应该可以从前到后阅读，每个章节都会建立在你之前所学的基础上。但是，它也可以作为一个让有经验的读者了解新主题的方法。每个章节都会关注一个特定的主题，并介绍从 Qt 和 QML 的概念。然而，Qt 文档将始终提供完整的画面，并作为参考查阅所有元素、属性、枚举等详细信息的伟大资源。

I wish you a pleasant read!

## Structure(结构)


The book can be said to be split into three parts. The split is not clear cut enough to motivate a strict division of chapters, but more of a guideline that we've tried to follow when writing it. 

这本书可以分为三个部分。虽然分界线并不明确，但我们试图在编写时遵循这一指导原则。


The first few chapters, let's say until somewhere around chapter 5 - 7 can be considered an introduction. If you want to learn QML, you should make sure to read these chapters. 
前几章，让我们说直到第 5-7 章，可以被视为介绍。如果您想学习 QML，请确保阅读这些章节。



The following chapters, 6-14, can be seen as fairly separate chapters introducing independent topics, even though the models from chapter 7 are used in many more places. Feel free to dive into these in the order that you like and learn about the topics that you are curious about.


接下来的章节，第 6-14 章，可以被视为相对独立的章节，介绍独立的主题。尽管第 7 章的模型在许多地方都被使用，但您可以随意进入这些章节，并了解您感兴趣的主题。


The remainder of the book focuses on more advanced topics such as details of JavaScript, mixing C++ and QML, and the Qt for Python bindings and QML. These are important topics and I really want you to read them. To build a full application with QML you need to understand these topics, but their main focus is not on QML.

本书的其余部分侧重于更高级的主题，如 JavaScript 的细节、C++ 和 QML 的混合、Qt for Python 绑定和 QML。这些都是重要的主题，我非常希望你能读一读。要使用 QML 构建完整的应用程序，您需要了解这些主题，但它们的主要重点并不在 QML 上。

## Never Ending Work in Progress(未完成的工作)

The Qt 6 Book is a never ending work in progress. We welcome contributors and are planning to open up our infrastructure to let you contribute both by reporting issues and by contributing fixes and new content. The end goal is to present you with a printed book when the material has reached a maturity level that we are happy with, but we want to share this with you already now and to learn from your feedback what to improve, and what additional content to add.

Qt 6 编程》是一项未完成的工作。我们欢迎贡献者，并计划开放我们的基础设施，让您报告问题并贡献修复和新内容。我们的最终目标是当材料达到我们满意的成熟水平时，为您提供一本印刷书籍，但现在我们想与你分享这个，并从你的反馈中学习要改进的地方和要添加的额外内容。
